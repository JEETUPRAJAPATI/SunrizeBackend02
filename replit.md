# Manufacturing ERP System

## Overview

This is a full-stack Manufacturing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system built with React frontend and Express.js backend. The system is designed to manage various aspects of manufacturing operations including orders, production, inventory, dispatches, sales, and accounts. The application features role-based access control with different user roles having specific permissions for different modules.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with Vite for fast development and building
- **UI Framework**: Shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Authentication**: Context-based auth with protected routes

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript support
- **Database**: Dual database support - MongoDB (legacy) and PostgreSQL (new)
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for PostgreSQL with type-safe queries
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with role-based authorization
- **API Design**: RESTful API with Express routing
- **Development**: Hot reload with tsx for TypeScript execution

### Database Design
The system supports two database configurations:

**PostgreSQL (Current)**:
- Drizzle ORM for type safety
- Schema defined in `shared/schema.ts`
- Migrations handled by Drizzle Kit

**MongoDB (Legacy)**:
- Mongoose ODM
- Models in `server/models/` directory
- Complete schema for all business entities

## Key Components

### User Management & Authentication

  - Super User (full access)
  - Unit Head (management level)
  - Production (manufacturing focus)
  - Packing (packaging operations)
  - Dispatch (shipping and delivery)
  - Accounts (financial operations)
- JWT-based authentication with secure cookie storage
- Module-based permissions system

### Business Modules

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Replit-based development with hot reload
